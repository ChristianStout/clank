# print

`print` is a built-in function in Clank. It's fundamental
purpose is to print a line to the console. This means that
it will always append a `'\n'` character the end of any 
[`string`](docs/primitives/sting.md) it is given.

## Note
To print without a new line, reference the
[print_inline](docs/base/print_inline.md) function.
